Welcome to the PowderBOOM source repository.
PowderBOOM is a game inspired by The Powder Toy, it is currently very early in development so don't expect much.

Compile
======================
You can compile by running the make.sh file or with this command:
g++ src/*.cpp -o bin/bin -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_ttf

Known bugs
======================
segfault when particle falls out of screen (caused by ptable)

Notes
======================
particle table is not used since too many segmentation faults happen because of it (pretty bored of seeing segfaults lol)
